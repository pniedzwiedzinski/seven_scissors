7scissors
=========

Pixel-perfect cutting and modifying software for Inpost delivery label. It cuts the images into thirds and inserts advertisement image at the bottom.

Usage
-----

As input the tool expects a directory containing files `page-0.png`, `page-1.png`, etc. Those files can be obtained by running ghostscript on file generated by Inport Delivery Manager.

You can use the script `./gs_shorthand.sh`, which I used to generate images in `example_data` (except I removed personal data)

	$ rm -r /some/dir && mkdir /some/dir # clean input directory
	$ ./gs_shorthand.sh etykieta_1234.pdf /some/dir
	$ 7scissors /some/dir/ 

As the output you can find images in your /tmp directory (AppData/Temp on Windows) that can be later converted into pdf.

See `inpost.cmd` for the whole workflow.
